Hi! I'm Ryan Yin, a first year student at the University of Illinois. I'm mainly interested in computer and network security, but I'm interested in a lot of different areas of computer science, from theory to machine learning to human-computer interaction and beyond! 

At the University of Illinois, I'm a Helper in [SIGPwny](https://sigpwny.com), a student organization dedicated to security and privacy. I've presented on topics such as [cryptography](https://sigpwny.com/meetings/general/2025-10-16/) and [reverse engineering](https://sigpwny.com/meetings/general/2025-10-02/), and I was part of SIGPwny's team at [CSAW '25 Finals](https://csaw.io/ctf), where our team placed 15th out of 47 teams worldwide.

Outside of school, I enjoy playing badminton, chess, and reading.
